# 10up Animation Best Practices

This repository houses the source code for the 10up Animation Best Practices website (TBD).

The content of this site is grouped into three different sections: Examples, Resources, and Guides.

## Examples

The examples section is meant for multiple disciplines, ranging from sales and project management to design and engineering, to be able to view simple demonstrations of 10up's animation capabilities. Examples show generally how a type of animation might be implemented on a specific project by giving engineers code samples to follow. Designers and UX may use them as reference or as a source of inspiration. Examples may also be used to gauge potential level of effort. We may also use them to confirm with potential clients that a requested animation is within the ability of 10up.

## Resources

The resources section has information for anyone wanting to learn more about the animation process in general, and will typically include links to third parties for educational purposes.

## Guidelines

Guidelines are one off articles that go into depth on one particular topic.
