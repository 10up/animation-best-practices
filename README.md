# 10up Animation Best Practices

This repository houses the example source code for the [10up Animation Best Practices website](https://animation.10up.com).


## Examples

The examples are meant for multiple disciplines, ranging from sales and project management to design and engineering, to be able to view simple demonstrations of 10up's animation capabilities. Examples show generally how a type of animation might be implemented on a specific project by giving engineers code samples to follow. Designers and UX may use them as reference or as a source of inspiration. Examples may also be used to gauge potential level of effort. We may also use them to confirm with potential clients that a requested animation is within the ability of 10up.

This repo is mainly for generating these examples, which are then ingested via a custom WordPress Gutenberg block in the 10up internal sites repository.
