    This is an sample HTML for copying when making a new example.
    
    Before continuing, be sure you've read the contribution guidelines.

    Here are some reminders:

    - We are using iframes so that examples can be entirely self contained. This is done purposefully. Do not add example code directly to the markdown document. You may add code snippets with "```" / <code> blocks to the markdown. Be sure to label those snippets accordingly.
    - Please refrain from using outside JavaScript frameworks or libraries unless the example has specifically called for that. (When building specifically in GSAP, for instance.)
    - There should always be a vanilla version of the example available. This is so projects that do not have the ability to use a framework or library for whatever reason can still leverage the boilerplate code. This shouldn't hurt projects that can use frameworks or libraries because they should be able to see the vanilla version and easily translate it.
    - Keep it simple. This is for multiple disciplines to leverage.
    - If you need an outside library or framework, include it via CDNJS.
    - Base styles are provided to keep to 10up design standards.

            Add a title here that is appropriate for your example.
            Always start with "Example: " then add the category, subcategory, name of what you're making, and the method.
            Here's an example:
            "Example: UI | Menu | Full Screen | WAAPI"
            This way, it is documented directly in the iframe embed what this is for.
